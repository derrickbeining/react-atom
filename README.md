# react-atom ⚛️ 🔄 ⚛️

**State-management _made easy_ for [React](https://reactjs.org/), built on
[React Hooks](https://github.com/reactjs/reactjs.org/blob/f203cd5d86c4c611a31a4f72c5a91e2db0858ce3/content/docs/hooks-intro.md)**

**~~Plagiarized from~~ Inspired by

[reagent.cljs](https://reagent-project.github.io/)**

## Elevator Pitch:

React's new Hooks API may very well render `class` components (heh 😏) obsolete.
Hooks like `useState` and `useEffect` enable you to share **_share logic_** that
is stateful and/or effectful across your function components, eliminating the
need for patterns like
[higher-order-components](https://github.com/reactjs/reactjs.org/blob/f203cd5d86c4c611a31a4f72c5a91e2db0858ce3/content/docs/higher-order-components.md)
or
[render props](https://github.com/reactjs/reactjs.org/blob/f203cd5d86c4c611a31a4f72c5a91e2db0858ce3/content/docs/render-props.md).

However, **hooks currently do not provide a simple means to share and update
_state_ across functions components** (`useContext` will only get you so far).
That means heavy-duty state-management libraries like
[redux](https://redux.js.org/) or [mobx](https://mobx.js.org/) still reign as
the most popular solutions for managing stated shared across your application.
Unfortunately, many find these libraries to be unacceptably cumbersome at scale,
_especially_ when using a statically typed language like
[TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/index.html). `react-atom` is meant
to provide an alternative, simpler solution by building on the new capabilities
exposed by React's proposed Hooks API.

**`react-atom` is a _lightweight_ abstraction around React's proposed Hooks API
that provides the ability to share and update state across function
components**. It provides all the power of heavy-duty state management libraries
and patterns, like `redux` or `mobx`, without bogging you down with a ton of new
concepts, conventions, and hard-to-remember proprietary APIs.

`react-atom` has a tiny API (4 functions currently). You can use an `Atom` as a
global state store and when you update its value, any function components the
reference it will automatically rerender. You can also you `Atom`s as local
state for function components, but the `useState` hook may be a better fit for
most of those cases.

Here's the gist:

```jsx
import * as React from 'react';
import {Atom, deref, swap} from 'react-atom';

/////////////////////// APP STATE /////////////////////////
/**
 * An atom can be constructed with `Atom.of` or its alias, `atom`.
 * Atoms have no methods and cannot be written to. The only way to
 * get the value of an atom is to `deref` it
 */
const stateAtom = Atom.of({
  count: 0,
  text: '',
  data: {
    // ...just imagine
  },
});

/////////////////////// EFFECTS /////////////////////
/**
 * `swap` applies an update function to the current value of the Atom
 * then tells all components referencing the Atom to rerender and read
 * the new state
 */
const increment = () =>
  swap(stateAtom, (state) => ({...state, count: state.count + 1}));

const decrement = () =>
  swap(stateAtom, (state) => ({...state, count: state.count + 1}));

const updateText = (evt) =>
  swap(stateAtom, (state) => ({...state, text: evt.target.value}));

const loadSomething = () =>
  fetch('https://some-api.com')
    .then((res) => res.json())
    .then((data) => swap(stateAtom, (state) => ({...state, data})))
    .catch(console.error);

///////////////// COMPONENT  /////////////////////
export const App = () => {
  /**
   * `deref` reads the value of the atom at the time of rendering and
   * subscribes the component to the Atom so that it will rerender any
   * time the Atom's value changes. It will automatically unsubscribe
   * from Atom updates when the component unmounts.
   */
  const {count, data, text} = deref(stateAtom);

  return (
    <div style={styles}>
      <h1>Count: {count}</h1>
      <button onClick={increment}>Moar</button>
      <button onClick={decrement}>Less</button>
      <button onClick={loadSomething}>Load Data</button>
      <input type="text" onChange={updateText} value={text} />
      <p>{JSON.stringify(data, null, '  ')}</p>
    </div>
  );
};
```

## Installation

`react-atom` has zero bundled `dependencies` and only one `peerDependency`,
namely, `react@>=v16.7.0-alpha`, which contains the new Hooks API that
`react-atom` abstracts upon.

```
npm i -S react-hooks react@react-atom@>=16.7.0-alpha react-dom@>=16.7.0-alpha
```
